# PokeCLI
This is a texted based pokemon battling game. The game will include the ability to make and save pokemon teams using the full range of pokemon and moves available in the most recent generation. Players will be able to battle by connecting to a server running on a known device.

This project is solely for the eductation and recreation of myself.

Feel free to use as you please.
